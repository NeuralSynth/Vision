# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Vision Assistance App
📝 Overview
The Vision Assistance App is designed to help individuals who are completely or heavily partially blind navigate the real world independently. It utilizes AI-powered object detection, haptic feedback, and emergency features to enhance accessibility and safety.

✨ Features
🔍 Object Detection & Distance Feedback
Uses the mobile device’s camera to detect objects in real-time.
Divides the field of view into 9 quadrants (3x3 grid) to indicate object location.
Estimates object distance using vibration motors (intensity-based feedback).
Provides haptic feedback for better interaction.
Recognizes household items and human faces accurately.
🎛 Interactive Buttons & Controls
9 on-screen buttons mapped to the 9 quadrants:
📝 Describe Object in Detail – Short description first, detailed info on press.
📞 Call Emergency Contact – Quick dial to a preset number (family, caretaker, etc.). 3-9. 🎛 Additional customizable buttons for:
Voice commands 🎙.
Saving object details for later reference.
Adjusting vibration intensity ⚙.
Toggling features on/off 📴.
Physical button shortcuts using volume and power button combinations.
🚨 Accident Detection & Emergency Alerts
GPS functionality for navigation and location tracking.
Fall detection that automatically sends emergency alerts 📡.
Health info storage at startup for medical emergencies 🏥.
